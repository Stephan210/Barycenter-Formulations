# Barycenter-Formulations
This repository contains C++ Code for Discrete Barycenter Projects

All scripts depend on Class SuppPt, which contains the 2D coordinates and mass for a measure support point.

Column Generation Folder contains the newest implementations for solving the discrete barycenter problem. These use LP General and are best for Data in General Position, when the support points lie in random, unique, unstructured locations.
